    <h1>Privacy Policy for FilmFlow</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 23, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>FilmFlow</strong>! We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected when you use our mobile application, why it's collected, and how it's used. Please read it carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>FilmFlow is designed to help you find movies without requiring any personal accounts or registration. As such, we do not directly collect any personal data from you, such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Data (Firebase Analytics):</strong> We use Google Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with our app. This service collects anonymous, aggregated data about app usage, such as app opens, feature usage, and overall app performance (e.g., crash reports). This data helps us identify trends, fix bugs, and improve the app's functionality and user experience. This information is not personally identifiable to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data (Google Mobile Ads):</strong> FilmFlow displays advertisements through Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). Google and its partners may collect certain non-personal information, such as device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address, and information about your device and app usage, to serve relevant ads. This data is collected and processed by Google according to its Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>FilmFlow may request access to certain device features or permissions (e.g., storage access). These permissions are requested only when necessary for specific features to function as intended within the app and to enhance your experience. We do not access or use these permissions for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>FilmFlow integrates with third-party services that have their own privacy policies governing how they collect and use data. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used for analytics and crash reporting. You can learn more about Google's privacy practices at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):</strong> Used for displaying advertisements. You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not share any data directly collected by FilmFlow (as we collect none) with other third parties.</strong> The data collected by Firebase Analytics and Google Mobile Ads is handled directly by those services according to their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>While FilmFlow does not collect or store personal user data directly, we are committed to ensuring the security of your information within the app's environment. The third-party services we utilize employ robust security measures to protect the data they collect and process.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>FilmFlow is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
